## Description

The BOARD repository is a set of Schematic and PCB files which can be used to build adapters for the STK500/STK600, Basys3 and other platforms. The design was made with Eagle and can be adapted easily. The Gerber files can also be found in the repository. We recommend to let [Elecrow](https://www.elecrow.com/) produce the PCB.
